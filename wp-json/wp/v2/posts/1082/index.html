He&#8217;s still using all his community-making muscles bringing people together, but the surprising things are that he is (a) going back to being more technical himself as he learns about distributed applications, the CAP theorem, and open source and (b) he&#8217;s getting called up to be on stage more often.<\/p>\n<p>We also talk about the &#8220;retail politics&#8221; of event-based marketing,\u00a0and how we&#8217;re seeing a lot of small events, specialized both by region but also by specialty or technology. We also note the importance of meetup.com &#8211; here are the <a href=\"http:\/\/riak.meetup.com\">Riak Meetups<\/a> worldwide.<\/p>\n<p>John talks about his upcoming event, <a href=\"http:\/\/techreckoning.com\/the-reckoning\/\">The Reckoning.<\/a> (Scoop: it is being rescheduled to Oct 18 to avoid clashing with everybody&#8217;s summer vacations.) He talks about working with startups vs big companies, and about turning free-form consulting engagements into more productized service offerings. He alludes to the dark art of pricing one&#8217;s services, but doesn&#8217;t really go into it. Is John&#8217;s role to DJ or to teach people to DJ? We&#8217;ll find out over time.<\/p>\n<p>John has also been speaking more and being called on to work the front of the room in partnership with the companies he consults with. He&#8217;s also developing more media properties\u00a0in partnership with companies. For example, he&#8217;s producing one podcast now, the <a href=\"http:\/\/next.nutanix.com\/t5\/Next-Community-Podcast\/bg-p\/NextCommunityPodcast\">Nutanix Community Podcast<\/a>, with another coming soon.<\/p>\n<p>Amy continues to work on the white spaces where the PR (public\/press relations), AR (analyst relations), IR (investor relations), and paid social media teams are not. In short, she works mostly with the geeks and bloggers. She is finding more resonance with the other parts of marketing, such as paid social and\u00a0field marketing &#8212; the folks\u00a0formerly known in the Geek Whisperers as &#8220;The Dark Side.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>She&#8217;s started a new podcast, <a href=\"https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/tt\/podcast\/elements-of-solidfire\/id978391847?mt=2\">Elements of Solidfire<\/a>, and has kept up her &#8220;roving reporter&#8221;-style program\u00a0by picking folks from around the company, giving them a mic, and sending them out asking questions. (After this podcast she also has started<\/p>\n<p>We end up answering the question, &#8220;How surprised are you at your current role? from a scale of 1 (not surprised) to 10 (very surprised)&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Matt came in at a 7. He is surprised about the speaking and getting to be more techie.<\/p>\n<p>Looked at from the 10 year path, Amy is at a 10, very\u00a0surprised that she is where she is, starting from her first tech event at Cisco Live in 2011.<\/p>\n<p>And John said 2-3, because he was thinking about this consulting and startup gig for a while. He clarified that this was from a 2-3 year time span &#8211; looked at over 10 years, he&#8217;s in a completely different place than he was.<\/p>\n<p>Join us next time for more interviews with Geeks about what they&#8217;re doing!<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div class=\"powerpress_player\" id=\"powerpress_player_3639\"><!--[if lt IE 9]><script>document.createElement('audio');<\/script><![endif]-->\n<audio class=\"wp-audio-shortcode\" id=\"audio-1082-1\" preload=\"none\" style=\"width: 100%;\" controls=\"controls\"><source type=\"audio\/mpeg\" src=\"http:\/\/media.blubrry.com\/geek_whisperers\/geek-whisperers.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/GW-Ep-87.mp3?_=1\" \/><a href=\"http:\/\/media.blubrry.com\/geek_whisperers\/geek-whisperers.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/GW-Ep-87.mp3\">http:\/\/media.blubrry.com\/geek_whisperers\/geek-whisperers.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/GW-Ep-87.mp3<\/a><\/audio><\/div><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_links_mp3\">Podcast: <a href=\"http:\/\/media.blubrry.com\/geek_whisperers\/geek-whisperers.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/GW-Ep-87.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_pinw\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Play in new window\" onclick=\"return powerpress_pinw('http:\/\/geek-whisperers.com\/?powerpress_pinw=1082-podcast');\" rel=\"nofollow\">Play in new window<\/a> | <a href=\"http:\/\/media.blubrry.com\/geek_whisperers\/geek-whisperers.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/GW-Ep-87.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_d\" title=\"Download\" rel=\"nofollow\" download=\"GW-Ep-87.mp3\">Download<\/a><\/p><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_subscribe_links\">Subscribe: <a href=\"http:\/\/geek-whisperers.com\/feed\/podcast\/\" class=\"powerpress_link_subscribe powerpress_link_subscribe_rss\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Subscribe via RSS\" rel=\"nofollow\">RSS<\/a><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>This week it&#8217;s all about us as the Geek Whisperers do a status check on their own careers.
