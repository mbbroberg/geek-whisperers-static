That was kind of my 20\u2019s.<\/p>\n<p>3:32 Sometimes you make people mad if you actually make things better.<\/p>\n<p>4:18 Wait a minute! I\u2019m good at this and those guys suck, so screw you guys.<\/p>\n<p>4:36 I\u2019m one of those people, if I see somebody bullying somebody who is junior, I\u2019m not very nice to them.<\/p>\n<p>5:12 Some people in IT, they like to build mansions. You shouldn\u2019t be building mansions. You should be building places for other people to live in and you move on to the next thing.<\/p>\n<p>8:54 The first EMC demo: If you had a good vision to do something, and you took the responsibility to execute it, they\u2019d let you go do it. And I just happened to be in the right place at the right time, to be bold enough to say it, and then I had amazing leadership<\/p>\n<p>9:56 How did he know how to do it? \u201cThe older you get, I think the more you kind of start to wonder, wait a second, how do I tick? Why do I do that?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>11:01 Did I know I could actually pull it off? No. I was taking a huge risk and I was scared, you know, out of my pants. And don\u2019t get me wrong. You should have my wife on the podcast and have her explain where she literally had to come bring me food because I wouldn\u2019t eat for 20 hours from sitting and trying to work with one stupid problem. And a lot of times the problems were things where I just didn\u2019t understand the domain. Something that would be really simple to somebody else. But I refused to give up, because I had to get this thing done.<\/p>\n<p>11:31 At EMC at the time, and it\u2019s infected me now because it\u2019s just how I want to work, there was just this camaraderie thing, right? It wasn\u2019t like I was just doing this for myself. Chad did a great job of saying, \u201cHey, we\u2019re all in this together, and you represent each other,\u201d and I met these guys and girls and they were amazing, and they were such a great team, and I wanted to do something for them too. \u2026 It wasn\u2019t like Nick Weaver did this, it was like The vSpecialists &#8211; our pre-sales team just build a keynote demo!<\/p>\n<p>15:08 I\u2019ve had people come up and compliment me out of the blue. And I appreciate that, but what I want to hear is, I like the part where they say, &#8220;Dude, you made something easier for me.\u201d That\u2019s the part I appreciate. I don\u2019t want to ever get addicted to the idea that people think I\u2019m awesome, because you\u2019re only as good as what you affect them with. \u2026 You\u2019re only as good as your last good deed.<\/p>\n<p>21:34 There was this point where the only way to get better at what I was, was for me to stop being the only one. And it was really yo stop being the hero.<\/p>\n<p>27:48 It\u2019s every day you wake up. It\u2019s like what are you going to do today that\u2019s going to be interesting? Are you going to challenge yourself or are you just going to skate through and entertain yourself?<\/p>\n<p>33:19 I worked under Chad Sakac who is just like a monster, right? The guy can just, like, communicate, he can make people feel good about themselves, he can figure out any technology at the drop of a hat. The guy is amazing. And I wanted to be like him &#8211; I still want to be like him. But the biggest thing I realize is that I want to be like him the way I am.<\/p>\n<p>35:38 Just don\u2019t look at somebody else and say \u201cI want to be them.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>36:48 Never ever judge somebody too early. Never meet somebody, assign what you think they are, and not give them a chance. Two reasons: Number 1, your\u2019e an asshole. Number 2, you have no idea how positive that person may affect your life, and you completely cut that out of your life.<\/p>\n<p>Nick&#8217;s blog:\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/nickapedia.com\">Nickapedia<\/a><br \/>\nNick&#8217;s Twitter account: <a href=\"http:\/\/twitter.com\/lynxbat\">@lynxbat<\/a><\/p>\n<div class=\"powerpress_player\" id=\"powerpress_player_1455\"><!--[if lt IE 9]><script>document.createElement('audio');<\/script><![endif]-->\n<audio class=\"wp-audio-shortcode\" id=\"audio-953-1\" preload=\"none\" style=\"width: 100%;\" controls=\"controls\"><source type=\"audio\/mpeg\" src=\"http:\/\/media.blubrry.com\/geek_whisperers\/geek-whisperers.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/01\/Geek-Whisperers-Nick-Weaver-Ep-73.mp3?_=1\" \/><a href=\"http:\/\/media.blubrry.com\/geek_whisperers\/geek-whisperers.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/01\/Geek-Whisperers-Nick-Weaver-Ep-73.mp3\">http:\/\/media.blubrry.com\/geek_whisperers\/geek-whisperers.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/01\/Geek-Whisperers-Nick-Weaver-Ep-73.mp3<\/a><\/audio><\/div><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_links_mp3\">Podcast: <a href=\"http:\/\/media.blubrry.com\/geek_whisperers\/geek-whisperers.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/01\/Geek-Whisperers-Nick-Weaver-Ep-73.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_pinw\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Play in new window\" onclick=\"return powerpress_pinw('http:\/\/geek-whisperers.com\/?powerpress_pinw=953-podcast');\" rel=\"nofollow\">Play in new window<\/a> | <a href=\"http:\/\/media.blubrry.com\/geek_whisperers\/geek-whisperers.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/01\/Geek-Whisperers-Nick-Weaver-Ep-73.mp3\" class=\"powerpress_link_d\" title=\"Download\" rel=\"nofollow\" download=\"Geek-Whisperers-Nick-Weaver-Ep-73.mp3\">Download<\/a><\/p><p class=\"powerpress_links powerpress_subscribe_links\">Subscribe: <a href=\"http:\/\/geek-whisperers.com\/feed\/podcast\/\" class=\"powerpress_link_subscribe powerpress_link_subscribe_rss\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Subscribe via RSS\" rel=\"nofollow\">RSS<\/a><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Nick Weaver is the Director, SDI Labs at Intel.
