					<description><![CDATA[Hey guys,
I&#039;ve been enjoying Geek Whisperers  for quite some time. Knowing at least 2 of you in person, I&#039;m sure neither of you would have predicted where it all would lead. It&#039;s been an exciting ride, that&#039;s certain. 

Having said that, I hope to see you all again on one of the many events in the world we might attend. Until then, thanks for all the fish
