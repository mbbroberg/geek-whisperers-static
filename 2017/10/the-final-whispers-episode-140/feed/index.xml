					<description><![CDATA[There&#039;s a sad sort of clanging from the clock in the hall
And the bells in the steeple too
And up in the nursery an absurd little bird 
Is popping out to say cuckoo (cuckoo, cuckoo)
Regretfully they tell us, but firmly they compel us to say goodnight 
To you
So long
Farewell 
Auf wiedersehen 
Good night]]></description>
