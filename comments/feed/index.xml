And the bells in the steeple too
And up in the nursery an absurd little bird

Regretfully they tell us, but firmly they compel us to say goodnight 
To you
So long

I&#039;ve been enjoying Geek Whisperers  for quite some time. Knowing at least 2 of you in person, I&#039;m sure neither of you would have predicted where it all would lead. It&#039;s been an exciting ride, that&#039;s certain.
