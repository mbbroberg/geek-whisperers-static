										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Alternative title:</strong> Goodbye, For Now!</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Welcome back to the final episode of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Geek Whisperers! </span></i>It took us a little longer than normal to publish this one because, as you know, this is our last episode for the foreseeable future. <span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve been doing this podcast for five years and feel it&#8217;s time to bring the show to a close. We share the reasons why the show is ending, and invite you to go back to the very beginning, from Episode 1, and relive the best moments with us! It’s been an amazing journey and we have had so many special times together talking to people successful in so many different ways. Thank you all for listening and inspiring us. We look forward to still connecting with you, our collective community, through different projects.</span></p>
<p><b>Main Points:</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This episode was taped live at </span><a href="https://www.vmworld.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">VMworld</span></a></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="/2013/03/podcast-2-first-you-have-to-show-up/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The first set of episodes</a> focused on the job duties we were all grappling with at the time. At the time we didn’t know much about influence marketing, and we can thank Amy for defining the term.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amy describes influence marketing as people, platforms, and content.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of our favorite episodes were where the guests <a href="/2014/09/the-nonlinear-career-path-episode-57/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared stumbles throughout their career</a> and what they learned, differing <a href="/2017/04/evangelists-find-your-career-bucket-episode-131/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">opinions on evangelism</a>, the rise of bloggers, and how good things happen when you add structure.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the course of the podcast, we got to talk with our mentors and learned so much about being brave, getting unstuck, and having a mindset of success. Check out around [19:45] to hear specific episodes that stuck out to us.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What we learned from our podcasting journey </span>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Three hosts on one podcast are too many!</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Edit less and publish more.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t walk away from opportunities because it’s hard or you think you’re not good enough.</span></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/AngeloLuciani">Angelo Luciani</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/Networknerd_">Nick Korte</a> share their The Geek Whisperers feedback as we bring the show to a close.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Quotes and Tweetables:</b></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I was trying to learn and struggle through some things and this was therapeutic.”</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">“People, platform, and content. Put them all together and magic happens.”</span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>And remember: we&#8217;re not going anywhere! </strong>John, Amy and Matt are working hard out in the community. You can find us on Twitter, participating in <a href="https://medium.com/influence-marketing-council">the IMC</a> or at events (all three of us are available for speaking opportunities).</p>
<p>And one more thing&#8230;</p>
<p>For contrast with the cover photo, here&#8217;s what we looked like recording together for the first time back in 2013.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a fitting second-to-the-end episode for us, the three of us discuss <strong>Influence Marketing</strong>. Bare with us as we dig deeply into the marketing terminology (along with A LOT of banter). If you&#8217;d like to read a little more before listening, here&#8217;s one against Influencer Marketing: <a href="http://www.adweek.com/digital/paul-johnson-lumanu-guest-post-wasting-money-on-influencer-marketing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">from AdWeek</a> that states <em>&#8220;Companies spent an estimated <a href="https://digiday.com/marketing/marketer-cheatsheet-state-influencer-marketing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$570 million</a> on sponsored Instagram posts alone last year.&#8221; </em>And here&#8217;s a Influencer Marketing pro <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ajagrawal/2016/12/27/why-influencer-marketing-will-explode-in-2017/#43545d6320a9">from Forbes</a> that mentions &#8220;<em>A recent survey revealed 84% of marketers plan on executing at least one influencer marketing campaign during the next 12 months.&#8221;</em></p>
<figure id="attachment_1650" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1650" style="width: 1024px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Screen-Shot-2017-09-25-at-2.10.34-PM.png"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-1650 size-large" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Screen-Shot-2017-09-25-at-2.10.34-PM-1024x369.png" alt="" width="1024" height="369" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Screen-Shot-2017-09-25-at-2.10.34-PM-1024x369.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Screen-Shot-2017-09-25-at-2.10.34-PM-300x108.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Screen-Shot-2017-09-25-at-2.10.34-PM-768x277.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Screen-Shot-2017-09-25-at-2.10.34-PM.png 2002w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-1650" class="wp-caption-text">Amy&#8217;s quote on Influence Marketing</figcaption></figure>
<p>We hope you love what you learn because we learned it from doing The Geek Whisperers for a number of years. Some notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Differentiation of Influencer Marketing vs Influence Marketing</li>
<li>Influencer Marketing: Paying people to interact with your brand (in Amy&#8217;s terms, that&#8217;s an Influencer as a Service)</li>
<li>Amy&#8217;s Earned Owned or Paid model</li>
<li>People, Platforms, Content</li>
<li>Influence Marketing Council&#8217;s, found at https://influencemarketingcouncil.com/</li>
<li>Influence and Advocacy as skillsets</li>
<li>How to work with people, not use them</li>
<li>Understanding what&#8217;s a pebble and what&#8217;s a boulder and when to use which</li>
<li>Word of mouth and relationship as an old school process (it&#8217;s the craft beer of marketing these days)</li>
<li>The battle for seeing value (through metrics)</li>
<li>Where you and your career fits into Influence(r) Marketing</li>
</ul>
<p>For your continued learning, read up on John&#8217;s work at the <a href="https://influencemarketingcouncil.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Influence Marketing Council</a> (which Amy and Matt both participate in). And get ready folks, the last episode is up next!</p>

<p>This week we tackle a topic bigger than a single career step. We talk about happiness as an intentional practice and Lorinda Brandon, Director of Developer Marketing at CapitalOne DevExchange, joins us to do so. She has over 30 years of time in the technology industry and has a few lessons to share. We talk about the importance of finding happiness at work, even at times of frustration. Including:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you&#8217;re going to have a tough conversation, always bring a snack</li>
<li>Can&#8217;t necessarily separate your careers from our lives</li>
<li>Misery at work comes home with you &#8211; pay attention to how they&#8217;re connected</li>
<li>You have a choice everyday to find a thing that makes you happy</li>
<li>Something easy for us to do could be impossibly difficult &#8211; and make them incredibly happy</li>
<li>Never underestimate the power of human connections</li>
<li>Assume people have positive intent</li>
<li>Alternatively, assume people are telling the truth and hold them responsible for it</li>
<li>How you train your mind to be positive and see happiness available</li>
<li>Everything is solvable</li>
<li>Leaning on quotes of inspiration</li>
<li>Events shape you. Don&#8217;t let something negative twist you though.</li>
<li>John drops a little science around the PERMA model from Martin Seligman&#8217;s work <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/martin_seligman_on_the_state_of_psychology">on Happiness</a></li>
<li>And we close with thinking of how to be a mindful, happy leader</li>
</ul>
<p>Lorinda can be found on <a href="https://twitter.com/lindybrandon">Twitter</a> or at her website <a href="http://www.lorindabrandon.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lorindabrandon.com</a>. Thanks for listening!</p>

<p>How many emails is too many emails when you&#8217;re talking to a recruiter? And how do they get paid? We answer these questions and many more this week with Liz Bronson. Liz is a recruiting consultant and was the recruiter during the early years of VMware. Her business focuses on the crazy portfolio of technology companies we know and love, so it&#8217;s a special opportunity to get her advice. She takes some time with us to fill in the gaps and refresh all our memory on how to be a great job candidate. Some highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>Before actively job hunting, do some soul searching</li>
<li>Good to keep passively job hunting too</li>
<li>Be prepared for an initial conversation (ex. look at the freaking website)</li>
<li>3 major types of recruiters: Internal, Retained Search, Contingent</li>
<li>Know how they&#8217;re paid</li>
<li>How a recruiter works to prompt a hiring manager</li>
<li>How often is too often to ping a recruiter? (Recommendation to check-in once a week)</li>
<li>Remember to be respectful to the recruiter. She is the gatekeeper</li>
<li>What do recruiters have a say or not?</li>
<li>Best advice of the whole show: the first offer you get is not the best and final offer</li>
<li>Truck of money jobs will not make you happy for very long</li>
<li>&#8220;Nobody&#8217;s life changes more than yours when you take a new job.&#8221; Ask the questions you want answered</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t ever complain about your past job. You&#8217;re making a first impression, keep it positive</li>
</ul>
<p>Liz can be found on <a href="https://twitter.com/lizbconsult?lang=en">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lizbronson/">LinkedIn</a> or her <a href="https://www.proactivetalent.io/our-team/liz-bronson/">Website</a> for consulting. If you want to dig deeper into the role recruiters play, you can revisit <a href="/2016/07/recruiting-as-technical-matchmaker-with-jill-jubinski-ep-114/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jill Jubinski&#8217;s episode on technical matchmaking</a> and <a href="/2016/05/tech-recruiters-are-matchmakers-with-andy-tullo-episode-111/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our conversation with Andy Trullo</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The three Geek Whispers get together to talk about the trend of going private in social channels and where we should hang out online these days. We talked <a href="/2014/04/going-private-in-public-episode-44/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a little about this in the past</a>, but the trend has grown even more so. People are gathering in new tribal regions online these days and they seem to be smaller and smaller. Where do you hang out? How do you find them? We talk through the options and opportunities to grow your<span style="font-size: 1em;"> private conversation as you build up a public reputation. Notes:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Twitter is no longer a guaranteed public forum for our communities</li>
<li>We&#8217;re talking Slack as opposed to Twitter</li>
<li>Blog comments are close to nonexistent</li>
<li>Instagram or Snapchat getting involved</li>
<li>Facebook started the trend</li>
<li>Leaving the public square to the walled garden</li>
<li>Influencers are killing it on private channels (like Facebook influencers)</li>
<li>Hitting Slack bankruptcy and starting over (Amy&#8217;s advice is quality over quantity)</li>
<li>Riding awkwardness into an invitation to a new Slack</li>
<li>Power of IRL relationships (and remember to follow up!)</li>
<li>Remember the power of regional groups</li>
<li>Why you should care about GitHub these days
<ul>
<li>Kubernetes <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/sig-docs/README.md">working group for documentation</a></li>
<li>Homebrew open issues <a href="https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22">asking for help</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>And if you don&#8217;t want to join the existing communities, start your own</li>
</ul>
<p>Conclusion? Today&#8217;s social is a lot about chasing the conversation you want to have. There&#8217;s no one place to be if you want to see the big picture. Find your tribes. And let&#8217;s see what all this means to you and your career.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Is the Field CTO the evolved final form of the Evangelist? And just how does an off-the-grid sabbatical change your perspective? We ask these questions and more as we talk with Nick Howell, who reflects back on his previous adventures as a technical marketing engineer and new journeys as a podcaster, blogger, and voice over performer.</p>
<p>Some of what we talked about:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Tech Marketing Engineers have a tech knob and a marketing knob
<ul>
<li>You tend to turn the marketing knob up and get less hands on</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Evangelist vs Technical marketing engineer</li>
<li>John said Guy Kawasaki was the first Technology Evangelist — this is not true, although the term was coined at Apple.
<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_evangelist">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_evangelist</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Reprise: <a href="/2016/06/when-not-to-be-an-evangelist-with-vaughn-stewart-episode-113/">When Not to be an Evangelist with Vaughn Stewart &#8211; Episode 113</a></li>
<li>Social media outreach as formal role vs something you do on the side</li>
<li>The old days &#8211; the rise of the blogger corps</li>
<li>Org charts &#8211; Marketing vs Sales
<ul>
<li>You’re sales if you have a quota</li>
<li>You’re marketing if you don’t have a quota</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Instead of a title of evangelist, we invented the Field CTO.</li>
<li>The Field CTO is a tech blogger that can bring executive cred to the meeting
<ul>
<li>On the road, closing deals, spreading the visionDifferences between: internally facing CTO vs externally facing CTO vs CTO inside the sales force</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Buying centers: Technical decision maker vs business decision maker</li>
<li>Spread of a function across the org as it become more mature:
<ul>
<li>webmaster was a job, now lots of team do web things</li>
<li>social media</li>
<li>“devops engineering team” will eventually become everybody’s job</li>
<li>Evangelism and social/online/community presence now permeates across the org &#8211; and in the field it can be called Field CTO</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Reprise: <a href="/2015/06/the-cto-in-the-field-with-michael-letschin-ep-89/">The CTO in the field with Mike Letchin &#8211; Episode 89</a></li>
<li>Do you have to be social/blogging to be a good TME?</li>
<li>Reprise: <a href="/2015/08/we-need-to-speak-differently-technical-marketing-with-tyler-hannan/">We Need to Speak Differently &#8211; Technical Marketing with Tyler Hannon &#8211; Episode 94</a></li>
<li>Differences between earlier tech communities and more recent tech communities</li>
<li>Open source &#8211; utilizing new platforms</li>
<li>Multiple platforms and the rise of Slack</li>
<li>Nick: Twitter is too flooded with corporate crap</li>
<li>Matt: Twitter is still the social fabric that connects us</li>
<li>Nick’s new direction: voiceover work and the Orbital Jigsaw podcast network</li>
<li>Taking a sabbatical</li>
<li>Reprise: <a href="/2017/06/staying-technical-and-customer-facing-with-leah-schoeb-episode-133/">Staying Technical and Customer Facing with Leah School &#8211; Episode 133</a></li>
<li>Nick’s sabbatical post had a huge response</li>
<li>We all have to be on alert &#8211; can we relax and take a break</li>
<li>Nick’s tips if you suddenly don’t have a job:
<ul>
<li>Take some time off &#8211; a few months at least (if you can afford it)</li>
<li>Give yourself permission that it’s ok</li>
<li>Take breaks a couple of times a year (if you can afford it)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Amy’s maternity leave tip: make sure there’s something you put down that you don’t pick up again</li>
<li>Matt: take time off. Your job is not that important. Matt recommends tacos in another country.</li>
<li>Company holiday shut downs are really nice</li>
<li>What would you never do again? Never go against your gut</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Greetings friends of and listeners to the Geek Whisperers. We have some news: at VMworld US 2017 we will record our 140th and final episode. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is not with sadness or exhaustion we end, but a sense of satisfaction in completing what we hope will stand as a helpful body of work. Thank you for listening, for sharing, for creating with us.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_201" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-201" style="width: 433px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/recording_geek_whisperers.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-201 " src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/recording_geek_whisperers.jpg" alt="" width="433" height="288" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/recording_geek_whisperers.jpg 600w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/05/recording_geek_whisperers-300x199.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2013/05/recording_geek_whisperers-210x139.jpg 210w" sizes="(max-width: 433px) 100vw, 433px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-201" class="wp-caption-text">Our first live recording back at EMC World 2013</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The show has forged a lifetime bond amongst the hosts, like a family who each has a role&#8211;metrics pusher, org chart hugger, tech philosopher&#8211;we’ll let you assign names and see if they fit. All three of us were always on together (with one very rare exception), even when it was Skyping someone in, or acting like someone was still on the line if they joined late or life made them leave early. The Geek Whisperers evolved together in this fast-paced world, and it has been a gift like no other. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_1423" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1423" style="width: 464px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_0187.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-1423 " src="/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_0187.jpg" alt="" width="464" height="348" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_0187.jpg 640w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_0187-300x225.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_0187-467x350.jpg 467w" sizes="(max-width: 464px) 100vw, 464px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-1423" class="wp-caption-text">Whisperers together at Matt&#8217;s wedding.</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re reading this and have joined us recently, we encourage you to take the time to listen to the catalog of incredible guests we have gathered here. There are some gems that we have referred to and continued to learn from through the years. And if you’re a long-time Geek Whisperers fan, there for the original stickers and the opening tracks, we hope you’ll continue to stay with us until the aptly numbered 140th. </span></p>
<p>We have 5 incredible episodes to publish and one last one to record, and it&#8217;s back at VMworld. <span style="font-weight: 400;">Just like Twitter, where it all started. 140 characters and episodes later, what a long strange trip it’s been. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Thank you for everything.</strong> </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You could be an attendee at an event or you could do more. What does that extra work do for your career? We revisit this classic balancing act with <a href="https://twitter.com/normalfaults">Nirmal Mehta</a> back at to DockerCon 2017. We start by asking about why he&#8217;s a Docker Captain, but his story is far more about being in operations and finding your Community. Nirmal&#8217;s story brings us back to the beginning of DevOps and through his journey of passionate hobbies that continue to help him grow.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Nirmal-Mehta.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1599" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Nirmal-Mehta-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Nirmal-Mehta-300x300.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Nirmal-Mehta-150x150.jpg 150w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Nirmal-Mehta.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>Some specifics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Difference of finding your tribe around D.C. (less new technology meetups)</li>
<li>How Nirmal &#8220;always needs to be in a constant state of learning&#8221;</li>
<li>We discuss the principle of Strong Opinions, Loosely Held (related post <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/strong-opinions-weakly-held/">from @codinghorror in 2008</a>)</li>
<li>Appreciation for the first vMotion like the first <code>docker run</code></li>
<li>Side projects as a tried-and-true method to career growth</li>
<li>If you every find yourself saying &#8220;I will never be doing that, you will end up doing that.&#8221;</li>
<li>(<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/261d.png" alt="☝" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> that might be you when it comes to coding as a sysadmin)</li>
<li>Attending <a href="https://www.devopsdays.org/">DevOps Days</a> to keep your skills up</li>
<li>Recognizing when you are the best person to introduce a solution to your company</li>
<li>How a sense of community keeps us moving forward</li>
<li>References to <a href="https://twitter.com/botchagalupe">John Willis</a> and his <a href="https://vimeo.com/134438318">History of DevOps</a> talk</li>
<li>Balancing your time and reflecting on whether you have it to offer or not</li>
<li>How if you ever feel alone, you need to reach out to see how much people have your back</li>
<li>A thoughtful review of burnout prevention (a very moving <a href="https://itrevolution.com/karojisatsu/">post by John Willis on that topic</a>)</li>
<li>Tribal indicators as a signal of what we care about, not as a sense of identity (identity is more than that)</li>
<li>Being part of the <a href="https://www.docker.com/community/docker-captains">Docker Captain</a> program and how it gives Nirmal a sense of connection</li>
</ul>
<p>We really loved meeting Nirmal Mehta and highly recommend <a href="https://twitter.com/normalfaults">following him a follow on Twitter</a>. You can also find him on <a href="http://github.com/normalfaults">GitHub</a>. If you&#8217;d like to learn more technical knowledge from him, his 2015 keynote at DockerCon can be seen here:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Who&#39;s hiring?  Technical Customer Facing preferred.</p>
<p>&mdash; Leah Schoeb (@vLeahSchoeb) <a href="https://twitter.com/vLeahSchoeb/status/841666220755714048">March 14, 2017</a></p></blockquote>

<p><span style="font-size: 1em;">Leah Schoeb has a background in hardware optimization that brought her out of the lab into the customer conversation. Since doing so, Leah has found that both are</span><span style="font-size: 1em;">important qualities to her enjoyment of work. The first starting point of the conversation centers on that point: </span><strong style="font-size: 1em;">why do you want to stay customer-facing when you&#8217;re technical? </strong></p>
<p>We discuss:</p>
<ul>
<li>How lab work leads to a customer-facing opportunity</li>
<li>How &#8220;an annoyance&#8221; like customer conversations can turn into a favorite part of the job</li>
<li>The strength of your network to find your next job</li>
<li>Signs of self-loathing marketer status for Leah</li>
<li>Scientists as Marketers (in technology and academia)</li>
<li>Moving into an Analyst role for an opportunity to learn to write articles</li>
<li>Digging deeper into the Analyst business types (learn <a href="/2014/10/research-analyst-a-dirty-job-but-somebody-has-to-do-it-episode-60/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more here</a>)</li>
<li>Picking apart Evangelism titles as it relates to Leah&#8217;s skills</li>
<li>Separating out your skill set from your job titles (like <a href="/2017/04/evangelists-find-your-career-bucket-episode-131/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in this episode</a>)</li>
<li>Figuring out the difference between what you like and what you&#8217;re good at</li>
</ul>
<p>Quick spoiler alert: Leah has since taking a Technical Account Manager job with <a href="https://turbonomic.com/">Turbonomic</a> and you can catch up with Leah on <a href="https://twitter.com/vleahschoeb">Twitter @vLeahSchoeb</a>. Thanks for listening!</p>

<figure id="attachment_1574" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1574" style="width: 267px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/renee-and-emily.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class=" wp-image-1574" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/renee-and-emily-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="267" height="200" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/renee-and-emily-1024x768.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/05/renee-and-emily-300x225.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/05/renee-and-emily-768x576.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/05/renee-and-emily.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 267px) 100vw, 267px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-1574" class="wp-caption-text">Emily (left) and Renee are incredible people who help you prepare as Keynoters. They have some great advice for our listeners.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Our guests, <a href="https://twitter.com/emhender">Emily Hendershot</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/runrenchicago">Renee Woods</a>, work at a company that coordinate events in our industry (including a regularly-scheduled virtualization-focused one). They collectively work with around 100 keynotes a year, so they have a ton of exposure to the best and worst advice you can get across industries.</p>
<p>Notes from their experience:</p>
<ul>
<li>Be visible so people can find you</li>
<li>Have a strong message you&#8217;re willing to share publicly</li>
<li>Sessions are for technical deep dives, keynotes are for inspiration</li>
<li>Always, *always*, go beyond the vendor pitch</li>
<li>Keynotes are there to anchor the conversation. It&#8217;s intended to have someone with a little bit of a celebrity level</li>
</ul>
<p>Some great tips if you want to speak:</p>
<ul>
<li>First steps to keynoting could be volunteering to announce giveaways or emcee part of the event</li>
<li>You&#8217;d be surprised how many people are looking for people like you. Help them by being visible</li>
<li>Career development is a huge topic these days, so think about telling your own story at a show</li>
<li>Groom some ideas of topics you would like to talk about and don&#8217;t be shy about sharing those</li>
<li>Even if you&#8217;re speaking for your company, own your content and own your deck</li>
<li>And never, ever, mic drop!</li>
</ul>
<p>Unless you&#8217;re finishing a post.</p>

<p>Evangelist is still a bad title in the long run (again)</p>
<p>Walk through the standard buckets at a vendor</p>
<ul>
<li>One model is: Sales, Marketing, Engineering</li>
<li>Another is</li>
</ul>
<p>Doing some org chart philosophizing</p>
<p>How the Marketing funnel is a perfect gut check for where your job fits into it</p>
<p>How a profession and a skill set is not the same thing</p>
<p>What are some of the roles you can land in for an Engineering organization?</p>
<p>and I talk about Product Owner type work and why that&#8217;s fascinating me of late</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We hope you enjoy it!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When people are paid quite well in the Enterprise Tech industry, why do so many people have &#8220;other&#8221; jobs? Is it a job for a paycheck or a passion project? We talk to Mike Colson about his past <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/colson.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-1559" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/colson-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/colson-150x150.jpg 150w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/02/colson-300x300.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/02/colson.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></a>experiences and how it brought him to a place where multiple jobs was part of the life for many years in his career. We dive into his past filled with dirty jobs then shift to how others can decide what&#8217;s worth doing in their free time.</p>
<p>This conversation stems from this tweet:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">How many jobs have you had, since let&#39;s say 18? <a href="https://twitter.com/Geek_Whisperers">@Geek_Whisperers</a> <br />* Episode Download Link (35 MB): <a href="https://t.co/yqxTkVGj9J">https://t.co/yqxTkVGj9J</a></p>

<p><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>The takeaways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Don&#8217;t always do the work for free (beware the &#8220;helping out&#8221; situation with businesses)</li>
<li>Create healthy separation between roles for easiest avoiding of conflicts</li>
<li>Draw the line when your work is taking away from your day job (honor your commitments)</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Being an engineer at an event is one thing, but how do you engineer an event? How can you make sure to meet those people you really want to?If you&#8217;re getting frustrated by the randomness of meeting people at conferences, this episode is for you.<a href="/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/delp1.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright wp-image-1530" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/delp1.jpg" alt="" width="314" height="314" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/delp1.jpg 400w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/01/delp1-150x150.jpg 150w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/01/delp1-300x300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 314px) 100vw, 314px" /></a></p>
<p>This episode is all about getting the most bang for your buck when spending a week away from home, and probably in Vegas. Aaron Delp, <a href="/2013/07/podcast-13-how-to-create-a-successful-podcast-with-thecloudcastnet/">previous guest</a> and incredible podcaster, helps us crack the code on events, the &#8220;podcast industry&#8221; there, and their cross-section. Aaron decided to hack this regular part of his day job and build a methodology to ensure he runs into the right people to ensure the growth of his social network and reconnect with industry friends.</p>
<p>The shortlist of how to do the same:</p>
<ul>
<li>2-3 weeks before an event, write down a list of people you want to meet (or learn from!)</li>
<li>Write down where you plan to meet them and how you plan to get in touch</li>
<li>Maximum 15-20 people for a 5 day show</li>
<li>Aim for 10-15 minute conversation with them</li>
<li>Find out where people will be at the booth (easiest place for them)</li>
<li>Have as many meals with people as you can (but leave one for yourself)</li>
<li>Get to multiple events a night</li>
<li>Make a point of hanging out with people you don&#8217;t know yet (even as an introvert)</li>
<li>Prepare for a long day, everyday</li>
<li>Bonus: Learn to play craps (but don&#8217;t do it too much)</li>
</ul>
<p>And now the judgement side:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do you publish the list or keep it private? Most on the podcast are strongly opposed</li>
<li>How do you feel about scheduling in time just for you to relax?</li>
<li>Do you still have the contacts you think you do or have they decayed?</li>
<li>Would you benefit by following these principles?</li>
</ul>
<p>You can <a href="https://twitter.com/aarondelp">find Aaron on Twitter</a> and as a cohost of <a href="http://www.thecloudcast.net/">The Cloudcast</a> podcast. We strongly recommend both!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>How does a geek move into the business, and how many steps does it take to get there? This week we talk with Ed Saipetch, Office of the CTO for IBM&#8217;s Bluemix private cloud.</p>

<ul>
<li>Co-host of the <a href="http://speakingintech.com/">Speaking in Tech</a> podcast</li>
<li>What does Ed do?</li>
<li>Office of the CTO&#8217;s role in the organization</li>
<li>direct reports and metrics (or not)</li>
<li>Ed started as an IT pro in a newspaper (6 years)</li>
<li>Got the chance to go to a VAR, then EMC, then Joyent, then Inktank, CenturyLink (2.5 years), now IBM</li>
<li>Always there was a personal connection</li>
<li>There have been downsides to moving several times over the last 7 years</li>
<li>But there have also been good raises and opportunities</li>
<li>There are sometimes corporate policies that don&#8217;t allow raises on transferring, even if the new job is at a higher level, which seems odd</li>
<li>The value of a network in careers</li>
<li>Do people know Ed from Speaking In Tech?</li>
<li>Things Ed would never do again?
<ul>
<li>Not take more stock options &#8212; turns out sometimes they <em>are</em> worth something!</li>
<li>Join a company that&#8217;s just being acquired &#8212; it&#8217;s better to be in the company that&#8217;s buying, not the company that&#8217;s being bought. Too many moving parts!</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Too much social media kills the golden goose? That&#8217;s our topic this week as we discuss a recent article in the New York Times. Our intrepid Geek Whisperers discussed this article from Cal Newport, <a href="http://put/ it on another stand-along landing page">Quit Social Media. Your Career May Depend On It.</a></p>

<p>A couple of points that we make:</p>
<ol>
<li>Yes, you can overdo it.</li>
<li>Yes, it is not an end in itself &#8211; just being on social and, well, socializing is enjoyable but may not do that much for your career.</li>
<li>You should practice long-form reading and writing. I don&#8217;t think we talked about it, but there was a lot of wit and brainpower that went into blog posts back in the day that now goes to Twitter and washes away in the stream.</li>
<li>Making something interesting is a career-builder, but people still have to find out about it.</li>
<li>Cal, the author, seems like a pretty privileged dude. One of his points is that if you do good work, people will find it. This has not been the case historically for people of color, women, and people from Eureka, IL and other places that aren&#8217;t from large urban centers like New York, LA, and SF. Social is a great leveler.</li>
<li>We don&#8217;t disagree that being good at your work is actually a key thing. Please, make an effort to be good at your work. The passion comes from being good at something.</li>
<li>Cal also doesn&#8217;t use social media which doesn&#8217;t give him much authority to judge how people use it, it seems to us.</li>
<li>The biggest refutation is fact-based: collectively, we&#8217;ve seen dozens and dozens of people take their careers to the next level &#8212; just be better at their jobs, get new jobs, even take radical career changes &#8212; by utilizing social media and networking professionally.</li>
<li>In fact, the Geek Whisperers lives are all better because of social media, and this podcast wouldn&#8217;t exist if we hadn&#8217;t met via our professional-social network.</li>
</ol>
<p>So boo-yah, Cal. Good luck with the <a href="http://calnewport.com/books/deep-work/">new book</a>. I do think training your attention span is likely to be a good thing.The micro-rush of endorphins from pulling on the Twitter stream can be indulged in too much.  I suspect if we all had a daily meditation practice there would be less stress and less idiocy in the world.  I recommend everybody put down their phone and <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-38094186">spend some time in nature</a>&#8230; but don&#8217;t be too hasty; listen to the podcast first.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So you feel stuck. What is a change that will make a difference versus one that makes you feel the same in a new place? How do you take a step back and review your situation? In a topic brought up by Matt and as a continuation of the Pioneers, Settlers and Town Planners model with Brian Gracely, we will dig into a couple models along with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Move from a state of independence to interdependence</li>
<li>Career plateau vs contribution plateau</li>
<li>Are you really looking for a promotion or do you just want a new challenge?</li>
<li>Shifting your contribution with the same job title</li>
<li>Work changes even if the title stays the same</li>
<li>Think of work as assignment based</li>
<li>Beware not contributing directly even as you work with other people <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Screen-Shot-2016-11-21-at-8.38.50-AM.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright  wp-image-1508" src="/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Screen-Shot-2016-11-21-at-8.38.50-AM.png" alt="Stages of Contribution" width="443" height="396" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Screen-Shot-2016-11-21-at-8.38.50-AM.png 734w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Screen-Shot-2016-11-21-at-8.38.50-AM-300x268.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 443px) 100vw, 443px" /></a></li>
<li>Amy fights against the working-through methodology</li>
<li>Refer back to <a href="/2015/04/making-a-powerful-impact-with-jeffrey-snover-ep-81/" target="_blank">Jeffrey Snover</a> and his ability to work through other people</li>
<li>Reflection on whether Stage 3 are useless middle managers</li>
<li>Managers can be at any stage &#8211; people management does not equal progression of contribution</li>
<li>The vulnerability as you move from individual contributor to people manager</li>
<li>Thinking about how you pitch yourself on your resume</li>
</ul>
<p>Career Plateau references:</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="http://bear.warrington.ufl.edu/weitz/papers/Career%20Plateaus.pdf">Career Plateaus Reconsidered</a> (Research from 1988)</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We&#8217;re joined by <img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright" src="http://www.ca.com/content/dam/rewrite/images/articles/Inline/Kurt-Collins-400-inline.jpg" width="260" height="260" />Kurt Collins, Director of Developer Evangelist and Partnerships at <a href="https://www.built.io/">Built.io</a>, to discuss his role and his participation in <a href="http://www.hiddengeniusproject.org/">The Hidden Genius Project</a>, mentoring young black men and teaching them to code. The audio is a little rough, but it&#8217;s probably because Kurt is enjoying a baguette in a Parisian coffeeshop.</p>
<p>We chat before he heads to API World about his work and his foundation. We get into:</p>
<ul>
<li>20,000 APIs being tracked by programmable web</li>
<li>At some point, we may all have our own API</li>
<li>Industry is still arguing the value of a Developer Evangelist</li>
<li>Come from a place of authenticity but still often connected to sales</li>
<li>Beware being an Org Chart party of 1</li>
<li>Business development is not as easily questioned</li>
<li>Evangelism helps credibility in the developer community</li>
<li>Know the lingo</li>
<li>What do you dress like when you&#8217;re between suits and hoodies?</li>
<li>Do people understand his position within the organization</li>
<li>Kurt&#8217;s thought: you as an individual have to define your role. No org chart will do it for you.</li>
<li>Must listen on the topic: <a href="http://packetpushers.net/podcast/podcasts/datanauts-049-cracking-nut-apis/">Datanauts with Matt Oswalt</a></li>
<li>Digging into a hybrid role</li>
<li>Evangelism is at risk when its not well-connected into the business</li>
<li>Have to be beyond the hype and know the tech</li>
<li>Developer Evangelism has the risk of being seen as a cost center</li>
<li>Position yourself for long-term revenue driver</li>
<li>Context switching as part of your life between org charts</li>
<li>Kurt&#8217;s first go from Software Engineer to Business Development</li>
<li>The ego hit of choosing to focus on business development</li>
<li>Kurt walks through a failed startup that inspired him to do more outside his work</li>
<li>The challenge of teaching programming was more about language (grammar, syntax) than STEM</li>
<li>Asked about work-life balance</li>
<li>Benefits of a job without a specific location</li>
<li>You have to do the worst job possible for a few years before you make it to this kind of title</li>
</ul>
<p>Kurt is an amazing guy &#8211; follow him <a href="https://twitter.com/timesync">@timesync</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What is the value of a technical certification? How do you make the time to get one? We talk with Gregg Robertson, who recently earned the prestigious VCDX certification. This podcast was recorded live at VMworld 2016 in Las Vegas.</p>

<p>VCDX stands for VMware Certified Design Expert, and is VMware&#8217;s highest-level certification. There are at the time of publications only 231 VCDXes worldwide; Gregg is VCDX #205. Gregg gained the cert only on his second attempt, and he estimates he spent about 300 hours on each attempt.</p>
<p>Gregg says he uses certifications to motivate him to learn new technology and get familiar with new areas. He took advantage of many online resources and an only study group &#8211; the VMware community is particularly known for its helpfulness for people preparing for certs.</p>
<p>Gregg&#8217;s tips:</p>
<ul>
<li>Consult with your significant other and get their buy-in! Gregg is married, has 2 young kids, and travels for work &#8211; a decision to study for a certificate is a significant commitment.</li>
<li>Be honest with yourself and your significant other how much time and effort it will take. Ask yourself: how badly do you want it? More than going out with your friends? More than watching TV? More than breathing?</li>
<li>Book time when and where you can. Gregg studied on planes and trains while traveling for his job. Everyone else was sleeping on the plane and he was studying. Everyone else was going out for</li>
<li>Regarding imposter syndrome. Especially for VCDX, the oral exam can be intimidating. Treat the panelists as your peers being briefed on a project, not as people trying to trip you up.</li>
<li>Gregg studied, did not succeed his exam, and then studied again in public. The accountability worked for Gregg &#8211; it won&#8217;t work for everybody.</li>
<li>Earning certificates is about the journey and the experience you gain, not the money.</li>
<li>For Gregg, the VCDX exposed Gregg to deeper knowledge in many areas and helped him realize how much he knew, but more importantly how much he didn&#8217;t know in each of these areas.</li>
<li>His best don&#8217;t-do-this: Don&#8217;t Do Too Many Things At Once!</li>
</ul>

<p>Previously on the Geek Whisperers: <a href="/2015/05/be-great-right-now-with-dom-delfino-ep-85/">Be Great Right Now &#8211; Episode 85</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Inflection points in your career &#8211; evaluate bigger moves</li>
<li>Put yourself in an uncomfortable position &#8211; you won&#8217;t know if you can do it until you try</li>
<li>Take on new challenges</li>
<li>Sometimes when you get really good at something, you can get bored</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t be comfortable &#8211; be comfortable with being uncomfortable &#8211; that way you&#8217;re challenging yourself.</li>
<li>Being Passive Aggressive, Aggressive, and Assertive</li>
<li>Being Assertive is about asking leading questions</li>
<li>Especially in group environments, this is a way to avoid throwing people under the bus</li>
<li>Building trust and loyalty; distrust makes people less loyal</li>
<li>Open and honest dialog make hard things easier</li>
<li>Managing with uncertainty</li>
<li>Fixing things under your control vs things outside your control</li>
<li>Pick and choose your battles; prioritize; communicate that down</li>
<li>Acknowledge the problems publicly</li>
<li>The Three D&#8217;s: Deal with; Delegate; and Disappear</li>
<li>The grass is always greener on the other side &#8212; because somebody took a crap on it</li>
<li>Not every problem is fixable</li>
<li>You will never be smarter than the collective intellect of your team</li>
<li>You lead the team, you don&#8217;t do all the work</li>
<li>If you ask (not tell), people will respond</li>
<li>Delegation tells you about people</li>
<li>Skills diversity is important</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t hire people like yourself</li>
<li>Being able to say No</li>
<li>Some things take zero talent but tell you a lot about the person: being on time, being motivated, being a self-starter</li>
<li>Technology can be taught</li>
<li>You can&#8217;t have ego when you get into executive roles</li>
<li>Why should I come work for you?</li>
<li>Never make an emotional career decision; always have a long-term plan</li>
</ul>

We bring Erin Banks (aka Banksy and <a href="https://twitter.com/banksek">banksek</a>) onto the show to discuss her move back to EMC as a Portfolio Marketing Director of Big Data &amp; Analytics.

<p>We dig into another angle of the &#8220;don&#8217;t burn the bridge&#8221; conversation and cover:</p>
<ul>
<li>Exposure to new challenges by trusted contacts</li>
<li>Choosing a career growth path (for Banks, it&#8217;s constantly learning)</li>
<li>Staying conscious of the people at a company are more than the company</li>
<li>The power of in-person relationships at overcoming generalizations</li>
<li>Remaining comfortable being uncomfortable as a theme for career growth</li>
<li>Easy isn&#8217;t fun</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week Sarah Vela tells us about bringing skills to the table at work, and knowing when to make a change. Sarah&#8217;s day job is in social media at Dell, and her recent non-day gig was as a co-host of <a href="http://speakingintech.com/">Speaking in Tech</a>, a role which she recently relinquished.</p>
<p>Sarah talked about her social media gig at Dell, how she&#8217;s been weaving more video into it. How do you find the part of your job that inspires you and give you passion &#8211; or how do you pivot your job so that it fires you up?</p>
<p>We talked about putting down and taking up. Sarah left her 4.5-year podcast host gig because (1) it was time and (2) she wanted to get involved with a local choir that required more practice time, and that&#8217;s where she wanted to spend her extracurricular time.</p>
<p>Four and a half years is a long time &#8211; even in a good job, it&#8217;s probably time to shake things up with new responsibilities and roles, even if you are in the same company.</p>
<p>(The running joke is that Amy Lewis was the &#8220;Snuffalupagus&#8221; to Sarah&#8217;s role on the podcast, because Amy often filled in when Sarah was out. Since the early days, I can report that they&#8217;ve both been in the same room at the same time, and that neither is imaginary and they are in fact separate people and nether is the secret identity of the other.)</p>
<p>We regret that we were not able to autotune Sarah at this point.</p>
<p>Sarah&#8217;s Twitter account: <a href="http://twitter.com/orchid8">@orchid8</a></p>
<p>The <a href="http://speakingintech.com/">Speaking in Tech podcast</a> website</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a throwback episode to our social media origins, your Geek Whisperers take on one of our origin stories: the prescribed tweet.</p>
<blockquote><p>Prescribed tweets are a method of sharing prewritten content that a colleague (most often marketing) requests you send (most often verbatim).</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/tweet-phelpsface.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright size-large wp-image-1439" src="/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/tweet-phelpsface-1024x689.png" alt="tweet-phelpsface" width="711" height="478" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/tweet-phelpsface-1024x689.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/08/tweet-phelpsface-300x202.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/08/tweet-phelpsface-768x517.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/08/tweet-phelpsface-520x350.png 520w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/08/tweet-phelpsface.png 1206w" sizes="(max-width: 711px) 100vw, 711px" /></a></p>

<p>Cons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Duplicate tweets on the same hashtag looks inauthentic</li>
<li>Harms your own brand if you use it</li>
<li>Minimal effort to add your own edits to it</li>
<li>You have to offer your own reaction or you harm it</li>
<li>Maximizing number of tweets is wasteful</li>
</ul>
<p>Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>Prescription is bad, reframe it as suggested tweets</li>
<li>Help those less native to the social media platform</li>
<li>Help those without the time to consume it all (see <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dont-Make-Me-Think-Usability/dp/0321344758">Don&#8217;t Make Me Think</a>)</li>
<li>Great method of internal notification</li>
</ul>
<p>Recommendations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Share links internally like you share externally</li>
<li>Help people know how to share it through frameworks, not prescription</li>
<li>Keep the formatting simple when you share</li>
<li>Prevent copy/paste-able tweets to avoid bad behavior</li>
<li>TL;DR &#8211; give people training wheels to improve</li>
<li>Consistent sharing is incredibly effective &#8211; get people hooked</li>
</ul>
<p>If you&#8217;re thinking about social influence, revisit these two episodes of the past:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/2013/04/podcast-7-corporate-social-media-you-would-not-survive-without-humans/">Podcast 7: Corporate Social Media &#8211; You Would Not Survive without Humans</a></li>
<li><a href="/2013/04/podcast-8-twitter-you-have-to-be-willing-to-give-more-than-get-back/">Podcast 8 &#8211; Twitter: You Have To Be Willing To Give More Than Get Back</a></li>
</ul>
<p>And if you&#8217;re looking for a template, I shared a model used in my past life here: <a href="/2013/04/podcast-2-addendum-social-media-activation-kits/">Podcast 2 Addendum: Social Media Activation Kits</a>.</p>
<p><em>May your internets remain authentic and your ideas become viral.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In which we ask the existential question: which would you rather have: an annual performance evaluation, a root canal, or a colonoscopy. Only The Geek Whisperers are brave enough to tackle this kind of cutting-edge question! Our guest is Srinivas Krishnamurti, and on this podcast we try to figure out why the performance evaluation process is so broken, and what might come next.</p>

<p>Srinivas is the co-founder and CEO of Zugata, a company that is trying to reinvent evaluations with software that collects feedback from peers along the way, not just once a year.</p>
<p>In this episode we talk about:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why performance evaluations are broken</li>
<li>What are the expectations of millennials in the workforce?</li>
<li>Hey, wait a minute, aren&#8217;t performance evaluations supposed to be a tool for improvement? Why are they always about money?</li>
<li>John&#8217;s secrets to a successful performance evaluation (dare them to mark you down)</li>
<li>Amy&#8217;s secrets to a successful performance evaluation (have a competing job offer)</li>
<li>Zugata&#8217;s approach to performance evaluations</li>
<li>Is personal development the employee&#8217;s responsibility, or the company&#8217;s?</li>
<li>Can a corporations even fix this?</li>
<li>Once again we hear this advice: it comes down to finding that passion about what you need to do in your job</li>
<li>Also look at what you&#8217;re good at, and go in that direction</li>
<li>At the end of the day, you have to believe in yourself</li>
<li>Follow Srinivas at <a href="http://twitter.com/skrishna09">@skrishna09</a> or mail him at sk@zugata.com</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When is <em>being an evangelist</em> not the right thing to get the job done? This week we talk with Vaughn Stewart about the implications of a title like Chief Evangelist, and why he changed roles (and titles) to VP, Enterprise Architect at Pure Storage instead.</p>

<p>Vaughn was a <em>de facto</em> and <em>de jure</em> evangelist in roles in the past, but always secondary to his role in technical marketing and in the field. It turns out one of the problems is that <em>evangelism</em> is often a matter of perspective. Evangelists will often use the power of their own personal technical experience and passion for the product to make an impact. As an <em>official</em> chief evangelist, on the other hand, your job &#8212; or at least the perception of your job &#8212; is to give the official pitch of the company. That pretty much takes a lot of the fun and a lot of the power of the personal testimonial about giving your opinion about the technologies you&#8217;re working with. This is about evangelism as a side gig and employee of the company &#8211; influence &#8211; vs being an official spokesperson &#8211; advocacy.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px; font-size: 24px;"><em>Vaughn reminds us that  we don&#8217;t need to have a title of evangelist to make an impact, and in fact he gives the recommendation that most of us shouldn&#8217;t take that title. You can certainly leverage social media without the title, and you may make more of an impact in the unofficial conversation.</em></p>
<p>We had a great time talking with our friend Vaughn about his journey. What&#8217;s also interesting is that working on job role and title fit keeps on being something you work on even at the executive level. Vaughn, ever the busy executive, talked to us on this podcast on the road on his phone, and in fact was <em>walking onto the airport jetway</em> as we signed off. Thanks, Vaughn!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week we recap our VMware User Group experience, where we talked with VMUG attendees about their careers and how to take the next step. This podcast was recorded directly after the Silicon Valley VMUG on April 12, 2016.</p>

<p>We had a line throughout the day of people who were interested in career consults. We&#8217;re grateful for the opportunity and we learned so much.</p>
<p>Matt had some interesting discussions about moving from the customer side of IT to the consulting/vendor side &#8211; looking at that shift in career track was a new thought to several folks.</p>
<p>We talked about moving into management and how that wasn&#8217;t the right role for everybody.</p>
<p>It was a mix of bringing new ideas to people and helping people get comfortable with the ideas they already had.</p>
<p>A few themes came up throughout the multiple conversations that day:</p>
<ul>
<li>Quitting your job is not the answer, although John did tell two people that they should look at other opportunities.</li>
<li>Mid-to-late career concerns. How to you keep up your skills? How do you justify the assumptions and any age-ism that comes with having been around the block a few times?</li>
<li>Job insurance: Are you investing time and effort in your career? You have health, car, and house insurance. How are you protecting your job if something bad happens?  (e.g., Make sure your LinkedIn is up to date, make sure you have your network in place by connecting at events and mentoring relationship, and make sure your skills continue to grow, perhaps with side projects.)</li>
<li>Examine your reasons for saying No. Why couldn&#8217;t you say Yes?</li>
<li>Know how to get specific when you talk about what you do. You are the expert on your own job, and you have the responsibility to be able to tell your own story. The concept of &#8220;Elevator Pitch&#8221; is no joke.</li>
<li>Assemble a board of directors to help you out.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t apologize. You&#8217;re further along than you may think. Nobody knows everything; nobody has experience with all areas of your profession.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Geek Whisperers had a great time. It was a unique addition to the event &#8211; one that I&#8217;d never seen before at an industry event, and we&#8217;re really honored that people spent some time with us for an honest conversation about their life and career. Thanks to Renee and the whole VMUG org for having us!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Geek Whisperers will be appearing at the Silicon Valley VMUG tomorrow, Tuesday, April 12, 2016 in Santa Clara. In this episode, we talk about what&#8217;s going to happen, how we got started talking about geek stories, and as always, Things We&#8217;d Never Do Again.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.vmug.com/p/cm/ld/fid=13108">Silicon Valley VMUG site and agenda</a></p>
<p>Amy Lewis is moderating a Tech Pioneers panel during the lunch keynote at 12:15pm: successful people, mostly women, who seem to be running ahead of the pack, and what it&#8217;s taken to get there. Check out the<a href="https://www.vmug.com/p/cm/ld/fid=13115#anchor1"> panel member bios</a>. John Troyer will be the token dude on the panel.</p>
<p>At 1:10pm, the Geek Whisperers will be doing career consults.</p>
<p>At 2:10pm, the Geek Whisperers will be recording a live podcast with the panelists, which you&#8217;ll see in this space next week.</p>
<p>At 2:55pm, Matt is talking about <a href="https://www.vmug.com/p/cm/ld/fid=13115#anchor1">Snap</a> in his Community Spotlight, <em>You Can&#8217;t Analyze What You Can&#8217;t Measure</em>.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re in the Bay Area, come on by. VMUGs are a great way to get a good sense of where the VMware and infrastructure community is at these days.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Christina Murillo started this show as a stranger to us. Within less than an hour, we were in awe of her work within the security community. Christina works in the IT Security scene in NYC &#8211; born and raised &#8211; and began by asking what a Tech Evangelist is.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/christina-morillo.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-1349"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-1349 alignright" src="/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/christina-morillo.jpg" alt="christina-morillo" width="270" height="270" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/christina-morillo.jpg 400w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/03/christina-morillo-150x150.jpg 150w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/03/christina-morillo-300x300.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/03/christina-morillo-350x350.jpg 350w" sizes="(max-width: 270px) 100vw, 270px" /></a>Before long, we had a cross-section of what Advocacy, Evangelism and what makes for an opportunity worth exploring. We discuss:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tech Evangelist, Developer Evangelism and Developer Advocacy</li>
<li>Being an engineer in the financial industry</li>
<li>Being a mother of 3 who contributes a ton of time to community</li>
<li>What we think an Evangelist does</li>
<li>Time required before being an Evangelist</li>
<li>Do you have to do the job first?</li>
<li>Her contributions to other communities</li>
<li>How all that matter is that you&#8217;re a Geek that&#8217;s allowed to speak</li>
<li>Walmart hiring for their Open Source software (OneOps)</li>
<li>The gap between marketing and engineering</li>
<li>Do you have to report to Marketing?</li>
<li>Can you Evangelize within conservative companies?</li>
<li>Do you have to be the first?</li>
<li>Evangelism used to be the type of work that you job out to consultant tech writers&#8230; but that changed somehow</li>
<li>We say millennials way too much</li>
<li>Understanding marketing as a benefit to Advocacy instead of a defaulting into Marketing Orgs</li>
<li>Get the job by auditioning for it (in or outside your day job)</li>
<li>Does Evangelism align best with vendors who sell something as opposed to a company like a bank?</li>
<li>John Podsplains us on the Finance industry</li>
<li>Developer Advocacy origins</li>
<li>What size company do you want to work for? What&#8217;s your mix of community and code?</li>
<li>Are we all imagining the Unicorn of titles without thinking through it?</li>
<li>Full-time vs part-time Advocacy</li>
<li>The challenge of &#8220;staying technical&#8221; as an Advocate or Evangelist</li>
<li>Her work on <a href="http://www.wocintechchat.com/blog/wocintechphotos" target="_blank">Women of Color in Tech stock photos</a></li>
<li>Finding the right job and not rushing into it</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can find Christina in a ton of places. She is a co-founder of <a href="http://www.wocintechchat.com/" target="_blank">Women of Color Tech Chat</a>, a Community Manager for <a href="http://www.codenewbie.org/" target="_blank">CodeNewbies</a> and volunteer for <a href="http://www.blackgirlscode.com/" target="_blank">BlackGirlsCode</a>. All of us recommend following her on Twitter, <a href="http://twitter.com/divinetechygirl" target="_blank">@divinetechygirl</a>, or looking her up on LinkedIn.</p>

The Whisperers spoke with William back at VMworld, and due to a number of lost files and a miraculous backup copy, we now deliver it to you.</p>
<p>We discuss:</p>
<ul>
<li>Joining R&amp;D from the customer side of the story</li>
<li>The transition from TME to R&amp;D Engineering</li>
<li>Filtering content and serving it up to the customer</li>
<li>Feeling closer to the customer by playing with the software</li>
<li>His role is diverse: &#8220;today could be VSAN, tomorrow could be NSX&#8221;</li>
<li>Starting early in blogging</li>
<li>Doubting the value of his blog (he didn&#8217;t believe people would read his blog)</li>
<li>The naming of Virtually Ghetto and its humble beginnings</li>
<li>Advocating for the customer within the company</li>
<li>Not worrying about politics or swim lanes, but doing the best work for the customer</li>
<li>Having engineers who wrote the code troubleshoot using your blog</li>
<li>Answering the questions: what are the use cases, how is it getting used, how do you fix it?</li>
<li>Providing feedback from customer back into engineering as well</li>
<li>Working for the enterprise versus playing in the startup lands</li>
<li>How&#8217;d you get here? Honestly no clue</li>
<li>Safe is a relative idea that doesn&#8217;t always make good or bad</li>
<li>We all have non-linear paths to the roles we get to</li>
<li>Do the work and share it publicly</li>
<li>Career planning is not his favorite thing &#8211; keep up with the passion</li>
<li>One takeaway: <strong>persevere</strong>. It will show</li>
<li>Gut versus metrics? He&#8217;s a gut guy</li>
<li>Fulfill the commitment and keep going forward</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t run away from the fear &#8211; there&#8217;s good from it</li>
</ul>
<p>You can follow William on Twitter <a href="http://twitter.com/lamw" target="_blank">@lamw</a> and on his incredible blog, <a href="http://www.virtuallyghetto.com/" target="_blank">Virtually Ghetto</a>.

<p>What career moves can we glean from the big company consolidations of late? How do you stay above the downsize? We spend time with frequent podcaster Mark Twomey, better known as <a href="https://twitter.com/storagezilla" target="_blank">Storagezilla</a>. He digs into industry trends, staying relevant with the times and his own development in 19 years at EMC. Mark works in the office of the CTO where he touches both customer- and engineer-facing tasks at the same time. We explore:</p>
<ul>
<li>Trends, changes and living within the Enterprise</li>
<li>Personal experiences as behemoth companies consolidate</li>
<li>Finding a job through personal networks</li>
<li>The differences of a long tenures</li>
<li>Playing the long game (grace before grenades)</li>
<li>Middle management exodus</li>
<li>Power is lost because circumstances change and people do not</li>
<li>It&#8217;s up to you to ultimately seek out new challenges</li>
<li>Passion is a reaction to events (that&#8217;s within your control)</li>
<li>Schedule the results you want first</li>
<li>Start a side project and honor it</li>
<li>Make a commitment with a team</li>
<li>Crowdshame yourself for fun and profit</li>
<li>You don&#8217;t have to say what&#8217;s on your mind and it isn&#8217;t cowardice</li>
</ul>
<p>Mark can be easily found on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/storagezilla" target="_blank">@Storagezilla</a>. He also has a monthly podcast at <a href="http://thedatacortex.com/" target="_blank">The Data Cortex</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What&#8217;s happening with the Geek Whisperers? Where have my weekly episodes been? Well, we have to admit we&#8217;ve failed you, fair listeners. And we&#8217;re going to admit it in the open.</p>
<p>This episode covers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Falling behind on podcasting</li>
<li>Life getting away from us</li>
<li>Trying to be This American Life for Geeks and not hitting the mark</li>
<li>Failing to admit we failed and move on</li>
<li>Personal stories from Amy, John and Matt on personal failures
<ul>
<li>Beyond the inoculation from failure we&#8217;re used to today</li>
<li>Startup missteps and the impact on a sense of self</li>
<li>Demos failing and making you feel like a fake</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It&#8217;s more relatable to be imperfect than perfect</li>
<li>Thankful for family and friends who help us get back on track</li>
</ul>
<p>Thank you all for continuing to listen and keep us inspired!</p>
<p>p.s., here&#8217;s Ira Glass on the gap between your goals and what you actually produce (<a href="https://youtu.be/BI23U7U2aUY">video version</a>):</p>
<blockquote><p>“Nobody tells this to people who are beginners, I wish someone told me. All of us who do creative work, we get into it because we have good taste. But there is this gap. For the first couple years you make stuff, it’s just not that good. It’s trying to be good, it has potential, but it’s not. But your taste, the thing that got you into the game, is still killer. And your taste is why your work disappoints you. A lot of people never get past this phase, they quit. Most people I know who do interesting, creative work went through years of this. We know our work doesn’t have this special thing that we want it to have. We all go through this. And if you are just starting out or you are still in this phase, you gotta know its normal and the most important thing you can do is do a lot of work. Put yourself on a deadline so that every week you will finish one story. It is only by going through a volume of work that you will close that gap, and your work will be as good as your ambitions. And I took longer to figure out how to do this than anyone I’ve ever met. It’s gonna take awhile. It’s normal to take awhile. You’ve just gotta fight your way through.”</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Glenn Pitchford is an IT director at a small nonprofit. We talked to Glenn at the SpiceWorld 2015 conference in Austin. Glenn talks about mentoring, being a trusted advisor to the business, and living the dream with a career in IT.</p>

<p>Some of Glenn&#8217;s advice: Don&#8217;t get stuck in technology and understand the business.  Being able to look beyond the IT department and the server rack &#8212; that&#8217;s where you add value.</p>
<p>Glenn was able to stay at the same place with a productive and fruitful career by staying one step ahead of the business with the appropriate technology at the right time &#8212; from the very first networks to today.</p>
<p>Glenn was an early member of Spiceworks community, A great article on Glenn at the Spiceworks community site:  <a href="https://community.spiceworks.com/topic/924025-dawn-of-the-user-death-of-the-dumb-terminal-36-years-in-it-with-glenn-p">Dawn of the user, death of the dumb terminal: 36 years in IT with Glenn P</a></p>

<p>This interview was recorded in an echoey room with a single mic, so the sound quality is a little rough.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We talk about making the rest of your life work well when the work part of your life is busy as we interview Nigel and Heather Hickey. This is another live interview from SpiceWorld 2015 in Austin, TX. Heather&#8217;s current job takes her on the road, and Nigel&#8217;s IT job does not, so he takes holds down the fort taking care of the house, 4 kids, and 2 dogs. Now they&#8217;re about to switch it up. How do they make it all work?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a lot of open communication, divide and conquer, and a lot of work For instance, Nigel is good at optimizing the grocery shopping, while Heather is the financial planner.</p>
<p>Since they&#8217;re not usually in the same place at the same time, it takes a lot of household official business meetings (with a bottle of wine!) to keep the wheels turning and things in sync. They are rockstar-level planners.</p>
<p>They have developed a number of tools that help them communicate, including &#8220;The FU Card&#8221;, which means that the person dropping the FU is super busy right now and will re-engage at a later time.</p>
<p>They&#8217;ve gotten buy-in and understanding from their respective employers.</p>
<p>They&#8217;ve established traditions and &#8220;them-time&#8221; to make keep the marriage on track. People at the show loved the story of The Big Purple Book, where they&#8217;ve shared personal notes to each other over the span of their relationship.</p>
<p>Nigel and Heather are getting ready to swap roles, as Heather travels less and Nigel goes on the road more.</p>
<p>Nigel and Heather spoke at SpiceWorld this year. Here&#8217;s their session, <em><a href="http://community.spiceworks.com/topic/1225804-quitting-is-too-easy-balancing-it-careers-and-the-rest-of-life">Quitting is too Easy: Balancing IT Careers and the Rest of Life</a></em>.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-1224 aligncenter" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/scott-lowe-vmware.jpg" alt="scott-lowe-vmware" width="450" height="249" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/scott-lowe-vmware.jpg 450w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/10/scott-lowe-vmware-300x166.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /></p>
<p>Scott works in the NSX team at VMware, focusing on open source and the surrounding ecosystem. He has been in the VMware space for around 10 years now and is well known for his books, blogs, and keynotes around the world.</p>
<p>Despite his expertise in the VMware space, Scott continues to adapt to new technologies and challenge himself to learn them.</p>
<ul>
<li>How do you know you need to learn a new technology?</li>
<li>Why is learning important to your career?</li>
</ul>
<p>We dig into the fantastic story of Scott&#8217;s career and begin to understand how important it is to keep learning new skills. We discuss:</p>
<ul>
<li>Early days of VMware</li>
<li>Early days of blogging</li>
<li>The slow realization of the importance of new technology</li>
<li>Continually adapting</li>
<li>Continually changing</li>
<li>How what appears like quick decisions were thoughts that evolved with time</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p><strong>&#8220;I think the most important skill for anyone in IT &#8230; is our ability to adapt to change: it&#8217;s our ability to change, how quickly we can change and how quickly we can deal with change.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>~ Scott Lowe</p></blockquote>
<p>We answer some questions you may have:</p>
<ul>
<li>But how does he keep evolving?</li>
<li>How do you evolve from interested to expert?</li>
<li>What drives his urge to share?</li>
<li>Do you think about your radius impact?</li>
<li>How do you stay driven by industry trends?</li>
<li>What motivates the move &#8211; fear of staying still or pulling forward into the new?</li>
<li>How has the Community impact your career choices?</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We talk to <a href="https://twitter.com/cody_bunch" target="_blank">Cody Bunch</a> back at VMworld 2015 about mentorship and how he finds the time to help others. Cody&#8217;s day job is as Principle Architect at Rackspace as part of the OpenStack Product group, but we dig into a passionate project of his that means a lot to all of us Whisperers. <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/cody-bunch-avatar.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-1218 alignright" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/cody-bunch-avatar.jpg" alt="cody-bunch-avatar" width="208" height="299" /></a></p>
<p>How do you find a mentor? How do you become a mentor? How do you know you should be one or the other or both?</p>
<p>We discuss:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mentorship is a mechanism to give back</li>
<li>The <a href="https://twitter.com/vBrownBag" target="_blank">vBrownbag</a> project as a one-to-many medium, with mentorship is one-to-one</li>
<li>Getting beyond stagnation in a career</li>
<li>Searching for accountability from peers</li>
<li>Finding time to mentor others</li>
<li>Finding time to be mentored</li>
<li>Pushing toward self-awareness</li>
<li>Mentorship is not going to come to you, and it most often is outside of your current company</li>
<li>Feeling the gap in the community and pursuing it</li>
<li>How do you start something like vBrownbag?</li>
<li>How did you let go of something like vBrownbag when you can&#8217;t do it anymore?</li>
<li>Reference to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zma4MIw7I_o" target="_blank">Scott Lowe&#8217;s talk with us on TheCube</a></li>
<li>Inspiration from community peers, like <a href="https://twitter.com/nerdblurt" target="_blank">Luigi Danakos</a> (who inspired me as well)</li>
<li>Fighting the urge to feel like an imposter when someone asks you to be a mentor</li>
</ul>
<p>If you&#8217;re looking for mentorship opportunities, reach out to <a href="https://twitter.com/cody_bunch" target="_blank">Cody Bunch</a>. You can also volunteer to help the <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=I+volunteer+in+tribute+to+help+@vBrownBag!+%23vbrownbag&amp;via=geek_whisperers" target="_blank">vBrownBag community</a> (click to tweet them!) and keep an eye on <a href="http://blog.scottlowe.org/tags/#Collaboration" target="_blank">Scott Lowe&#8217;s programs</a>. Keep making us all better by volunteering your time!</p>

He&#8217;s grown into leadership, starting as an <img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class=" wp-image-1198 alignright" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/ChadSakac_Cropped.jpg" alt="ChadSakac_Cropped" width="317" height="262" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/ChadSakac_Cropped.jpg 360w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/10/ChadSakac_Cropped-300x248.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 317px) 100vw, 317px" />individual contributor and is now up to 4,000 &#8220;nerds in the field,&#8221; and that&#8217;s just part of his day job. We discuss the unbelievable awesomeness of Chad&#8217;s job and recognizing the challenges he goes through at the same time. Some topics we cover include:</p>
<ul>
<li>How Chad&#8217;s job extends beyond the day job</li>
<li>Work/life balance is an illusion</li>
<li>Better analogy is more like a marathon with sprints (sprint, rest, sprint, rest)</li>
<li>The challenge of a distributed team and how it leads to crazy travel hours</li>
<li>Be mindful of what you want in your career (the <em>quid quo pros</em>)</li>
<li>The balance of incredible happiness and incredible tragedies</li>
<li>How to roll with the sheer scale of the work</li>
<li>Balancing the micro and macro view of the job</li>
<li>The difference between understanding politics and being a politician</li>
<li>Speaking truth to power &#8220;without being a doink&#8221;</li>
<li>How authenticity brings its own power</li>
<li>The unconscious process of his career growth</li>
<li>How social media is part of the formula these days</li>
<li>How the web of influence transcends organizational boundaries</li>
<li>Mapping &#8220;impact radius&#8221; of company contributors</li>
<li>His advice to us all: <strong>take bigger risks earlier</strong></li>
<li>Beware the &#8220;Us vs Them&#8221; dynamic to team building</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A few specific questions we dig in on:</p>
<ul>
<li>How do you go from managing 10 people to 4,000 people?</li>
<li>What would Chad say to Younger Chad if he had a time machine?</li>
<li>Can people adapt to Unicorn culture or do you grow them?</li>
<li>What is <strong>culture in a team</strong> &#8211; the process? The people?</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And, especially for Amy, here&#8217;s <strong>Chad by the numbers:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>President of 4,000 people</li>
<li>Father of 2 daughters</li>
<li>Receives 3,000 emails a day</li>
<li>He has 17.7K followers on Twitter</li>
<li>This episode is a 53 minutes long, which is a bonus 23 minutes than most <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This episode was recorded well before the Dell and EMC merger news, so don&#8217;t anticipate any of that here. Thank you again to Chad for these incredible insights. Be sure to read his personal and professional thoughts at <a href="http://virtualgeek.typepad.com/">http://virtualgeek.typepad.com/</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Audio on this one is pretty terrible, but it&#8217;s worth turning up the volume.</strong></p>
<p>What is the next job move when you co-found a company that&#8217;s grown to be a huge success? You have the option to stay and the option to transition out. This happened to Scott Abel, CSO of Spiceworks, who we talked to this week on the Geek Whisperers. This interview was recorded live at SpiceWorld 2015 in Austin, TX.</p>
<p>We <a href="/spiceworks-whisperings-at-spiceworld/" target="_blank">spoke to Scott last SpiceWorld</a> about the cultural of Spiceworks. This year we hear more of Scott&#8217;s personal story.</p>
<p>Spiceworks was the third startup founded or co-founded by Scott, and this time they wanted to get it right. By making lists of the things they wanted to bring to the new company and the things they didn&#8217;t want to bring into this new company. Some of these lessons came from Scott&#8217;s time as VP of Professional Services at NeXT, and the lessons he learned (both things To Do and things Not To Do) from Steve Jobs.</p>
<p>More topics:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://austin.eater.com/maps/where-to-eat-austin-breakfast-tacos-to-try" target="_blank">Breakfast tacos</a> &#8211; an Austin speciality</li>
<li>When starting a company, how do you know what to do?</li>
<li>Evaluating the risks of starting a company</li>
<li>Do you grow up knowing you want to start companies?</li>
<li>The method acting practice of founding a startup</li>
<li>Figuring out what makes a company by building them</li>
<li>Cheating your way into learning to be a Founder</li>
<li>Taking the paycheck cut to start the startup</li>
<li>A little bit of what it was like to work with Steve Jobs</li>
<li>Building the culture you always wanted</li>
<li>Launching a product for the first time and leaving room for people to make the right choices</li>
<li>How to compete in a commodity market</li>
<li>How life experiences shape your career path</li>
<li>Transitioning from CEO to CSO</li>
</ul>
<p>Thank you, yet again, to the Spiceworks team and Scott for this opportunity to talk. See all our past <a href="/spiceworks-whisperings-at-spiceworld/" target="_blank">SpiceWorld episodes here</a>!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Welcome back to another episode of the Geek Whisperers! While we were live at VMworld 2015, we jumped on the vBrownBag stage and discussing localized community with the vBrisket guys.</p>
<p>You may recognize their handy work around the Pittsburgh area and for throwing a great event at VMworld 2015. They also have incredible style, personified by Amy Lewis&#8217; vBrisket apron.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sSttS4115Zw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>We&#8217;re joined by two of the co-founders of vBrisket: <a href="https://twitter.com/penlem166" target="_blank">Jaison Bailley</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/johnbrescia" target="_blank">John Brescia</a>. These two, along with <a href="https://twitter.com/gmaentz" target="_blank">Gabe Maentz</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/ClintWyckoff" target="_blank">Clint Wyckoff</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/Mike_Colson" target="_blank">Mike Colson</a>, have found a niche within their local community that <strong>mixes delicious BBQ and career lessons learned</strong>. We discuss their story:</p>
<ul>
<li>Started by winning a 3D printer and turned into a BBQ smoker</li>
<li>Why <a href="https://www.vmug.com/" target="_blank">VMUG</a> and <a href="http://www.vbeers.org/" target="_blank">vBeers</a> organizations didn&#8217;t cut it in Pittsburg</li>
<li>Going full bore into a project and seeing what comes out</li>
<li>The off-the-wall idea that stuck</li>
<li>Starts with peer-to-peer accountability</li>
<li>Grown into vendor agnostic communications</li>
<li>How to get the word out to local community and how word of mouth still works</li>
<li>Keeping the pool of users small and passionate</li>
<li>What lead Jaison, John and others to get involved here?</li>
<li>Is there room for selective, artisanal communities in Enterprise IT?</li>
<li>How to communicate upfront with vendors in Enterprise IT</li>
<li>The power of secondary markets</li>
<li>Valuing name recognition as a Marketing effort</li>
<li>How learning and mentorship is involved in the program</li>
<li>Remembering to let others commit to the community: don&#8217;t do it for them</li>
<li>Recognizing the power of your existing community</li>
<li>Recognize your ability to help others remain accountable and grow the community</li>
</ul>
<p>To learn more about these programs:<br />

His journey goes from database administration to technical orator and he has a great view of the many parts of the Enterprise IT world.</p>
<p>I  (Matt) have the pleasure of working with Tyler and put our heads together to walk through the marketing side of technology storytelling.</p>
<p>In this episode, we cover:</p>
<ul>
<li>Engineers who like to speak for a living</li>
<li>Marketers who have a passion for technology</li>
<li>Org charts, org charts, org charts</li>
<li>The difference between Technical Marketing and Product Marketing</li>
<li>Delivering the new normal of content: more technical, more interesting</li>
<li>Developer Advocates, Technical Evangelists and Solution Architects</li>
<li>The internal enablement work and external communications</li>
<li>Are you a Marketer who is technical or an Engineer who likes marketing? Is there only one path?</li>
<li>Staying happy marketing and happy staying technical</li>
<li>The organizational recognition of valuing both skills</li>
<li>How TME roles <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law" target="_blank">let Conway&#8217;s Law</a> play nicely inside the company</li>
<li>Is this planned or accidental career paths?</li>
<li>Consumption of content as metric vs gut-based marketing?</li>
<li>What skills makes for a good TME?</li>
<li>What&#8217;s the career path for a Technical Marketer? Where do organizations go from here?</li>
</ul>
<p>A little non sequitur, this is my favorite talk by Tyler:</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MboWxOKP4-Y?start=20&#038;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>What&#8217;s important to glean from this conversation is a recognition that staying technical is not only a valid option for those interested in marketing, but it&#8217;s a necessary step for Enterprise IT companies from small startup to massive enterprise.</p>
<p>Keep an eye out for the TME roles and share your story with us <a href="http://twitter.com/geek_whisperers" target="_blank">@Geek_Whisperers</a>.</p>
